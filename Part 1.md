<h1>Investigative Plan of Action - Part 1/2</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project outlines an investigative plan to address a suspected data breach involving proprietary information. The plan involves seizing relevant devices, acquiring and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions based on the evidence. Key strategies include minimizing disruption to the organization, preserving evidence integrity, and utilizing advanced forensic tools. The goal is to provide clear and compelling evidence to support or refute the allegations.
<br />


<h2>Scenario</h2>
An oil company’s senior management has reason to suspect that John Smith, one of the company’s mechanical engineers, allegedly took information that was clearly identified as proprietary. The company’s legal office has requested digital evidence regarding the potential violation of company policy, which prohibits the sharing of proprietary information without prior approval. The employee was not authorized to access proprietary information. All employees sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) and acceptable use policies (AUPs). Senior management and the legal office have approved the request for digital evidence.<br />
